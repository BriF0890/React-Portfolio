    <div><h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Brianca Foster. I am currently a freelance Graphic Desginer and looking to expand my knowlegde to the next level. Striving for excellence is the main key to being successful in the business industry. Working with a driven mindset, and learning new techniques is what I hunger for. Love working with groups and tackling different projects. The main goal is making sure that the client is happy with the masterpiece that is shown to them. If you do not push yourself each day, then you will never learn more than what you know. It's not bad to try new things, it helps make you even better than before. </p>
